## Clear dependency managagement

Tests clearly state their dependencies through fixture parameters, making the code more readable and self-documenting.

```ts
// Playwright handles the dependency chain automatically
test("user profile test", async ({ page, loggedInUser }) => {
  // loggedInUser fixture might depend on page fixture
});
```

No spaghetti!!!

## Clear config management

## Automatic setup and teardown
